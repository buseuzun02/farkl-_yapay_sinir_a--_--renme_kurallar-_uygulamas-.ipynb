Added interactive neural network learning simulator

This Python program allows users to experiment with various neural network learning rules, including Hebb, Perceptron, Delta, and Widrow-Hoff. 
Users can:
- Input initial weights, input vectors, and target values
- Choose a learning rule and activation function (Step, Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Bipolar variants)
- Observe step-by-step weight updates and net input/output calculations
- Adjust learning rate and regularization parameters

Useful for educational purposes and understanding how different learning rules update weights in a single-layer neural network.
